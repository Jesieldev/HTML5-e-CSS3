    <h1>Letra da Música Phantom of the Opera</h1>
    <pre>
        <p> 
            In sleep he sang to me
            In dreams he came
            That voice which calls to me
            And speaks my name
            And do I dream again?
            For now I find
            The phantom of the opera is there
            Inside my mind
            Sing once again with me
            Our strange duet
            My power over you
            Grows stronger yet
            And though you turn from me
            And glance behind
            The phantom of the opera is there
            Inside your mind
            Those who have seen your face
            Draw back in fear
            I am the mask you wear
            It's me they hear
            Your spirit and your voice
            In one combined
            The phantom of the opera is there
            Inside my mind
            In all your fantasies
            You always knew
            That man and mystery
            Were both in you
            And in this labyrinth
            Where night is blind
            The phantom of the opera is there
            Inside my mind
            Sing for me my angel of music
            He's there, the phantom of the opera
            Sing for me
            Ah, ah
            Sing my angel of music
            Ah, ah
            Sing for me, sing for me</p>
